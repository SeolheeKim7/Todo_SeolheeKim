- **Dynamic Priority Queue:**
  - The queue dynamically adjusts to prioritize tasks based on their importance levels, ensuring higher priority tasks are processed first.

- **User Interface:**
  - The intuitive user interface allows users to easily enter new ToDo items, specifying their importance level.

- **Task Completion:**
  - Users can mark the top goal as completed, removing it from the queue.

- **Viewing Options:**
  - Users can view the next item in their ToDo list or access a comprehensive list of all goals.

- **Statistics:**
  - The application keeps track of and displays:
    - Total number of ToDo items
    - Number of items for each importance level
